# 💻 Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about a population parameter based on a sample statistic. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses—the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁)—and using sample data to determine which hypothesis is supported by the evidence.

### 1. Understanding Hypothesis Testing

1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: This is the hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference. It is the status quo that we assume to be true unless there is strong evidence against it. For example, "The mean body temperature of humans is 37°C."

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: This is the hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference. It represents what we are trying to find evidence for. For example, "The mean body temperature of humans is not 37°C."

3. **Test Statistic**: A value calculated from the sample data that is used to evaluate the null hypothesis. For example, the t-statistic in a t-test.

4. **p-Value**: The probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

5. **Decision Rule**: Based on the p-value, we either reject the null hypothesis (if p ≤ 0.05) or fail to reject it (if p > 0.05).

### 2. Hypothesis Testing on One Mean

#### 2.1 `t.test()` for One Mean

The `t.test()` function in R is used to test whether the sample mean is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean. Here’s the general syntax:

```r
t.test(x, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

- `x`: A numeric vector of data values.
- `mu`: The hypothesized value of the population mean (default is 0).
- `alternative`: Specifies the alternative hypothesis. It can be `"two.sided"`, `"greater"`, or `"less"`.
- `conf.level`: Confidence level for the confidence interval (default is 0.95).

#### 2.2 Example: Testing Average Body Temperature

Let's test whether the average body temperature of a sample of patients is significantly different from 37°C.

```{r bodytemponemean, echo=TRUE}
# Sample data: body temperatures in degrees Celsius
body_temp <- c(36.7, 36.9, 37.1, 37.2, 37.3, 36.8, 37.0, 36.6)

# Perform one-sample t-test
t.test(body_temp, mu = 37)
```

In this example, we are testing if the mean body temperature is significantly different from 37°C.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing on Two Means

When comparing the means of two independent groups, we use a two-sample t-test.

#### 3.1 `t.test()` for Two Independent Means

The `t.test()` function can also be used to compare two means. Here’s the syntax:

```r
t.test(x, y, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

- `x`, `y`: Numeric vectors of data values representing the two groups.
- `var.equal`: Logical value indicating whether to assume equal variances (default is `FALSE`).

#### 3.2 Example: Comparing Treatment and Control Groups

Suppose we have data on the weight loss of patients in two groups: a treatment group and a control group.

```{r weightlosstwomean, echo=TRUE}
# Sample data: weight loss in kg
treatment <- c(4.5, 5.0, 4.7, 6.2, 5.1)
control <- c(2.1, 2.4, 2.3, 2.0, 1.9)

# Perform two-sample t-test
t.test(treatment, control)
```

In this example, we are testing if the average weight loss in the treatment group is significantly different from that in the control group.

### 4. Parameters of `t.test()` in Detail

The `t.test()` function in R has several parameters that can be adjusted depending on the specific hypothesis being tested:

- **x**: The sample data for a one-sample test or the first group for a two-sample test.
- **y**: The second group for a two-sample test. This parameter is left blank for one-sample tests.
- **alternative**: Specifies the alternative hypothesis. Options are:
  - `"two.sided"`: The default option. Tests if the sample mean is different from the hypothesized mean.
  - `"greater"`: Tests if the sample mean is greater than the hypothesized mean.
  - `"less"`: Tests if the sample mean is less than the hypothesized mean.
- **mu**: The hypothesized population mean.
- **paired**: A logical value indicating whether to perform a paired t-test. Defaults to `FALSE`.
- **var.equal**: A logical value indicating whether to assume equal variances in the two-sample test. Defaults to `FALSE`.
- **conf.level**: The confidence level for the confidence interval, usually set to 0.95.
