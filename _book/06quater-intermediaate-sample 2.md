# 💻 Intermediate Sample Questions {#int-samp-q}

Hi guys, this is your favourite **TA**, I am just aggregating questions that have been asked in previous exam sessions the previous years i.e. 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. They are representative of the actual exam, but you know, take it like a grain of salt. 

I will also make sure to provide to you some other exercises if you are still anxious.

What is the correct definition of the **variance inflation factor** i.e. VIF?


1. $1-R2$ 
1. $\frac{1}{R2}$  
1. $\frac{1}{1-R2}$
1. $1-\frac{1}{R2}$

:::


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise \@ref(exr:int19)**:

A general guideline is that a VIF larger than 5 or 10 is large, indicating that the model has problems estimating the coefficient. However, this in general does not degrade the quality of predictions. If the VIF is larger than 1/(1-R2), where R2 is the Multiple R-squared of the regression, then that predictor is more related to the other predictors than it is to the response.

    install.packages("regclass")
    library(regclass)
    VIF(modello_regressione)
    
alternatively you can use the library `car` and use `vif()` function

categories *setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*. If we would like to
compare means across these 3 different categories we can't use
`t.test()` since they are 3. Instead we use **ANOVA** with the `aov()`.
Sintax is similar to linear models. We saw this when we were trying to
tackle "long" format data vs. "wide" format data.

    library(spdep)

you are not required to load data in this case since the package already
does it for you. SO you just need to type `boston.c` and you find it.
Then you need to extract `RM`

    RM_var = boston.c$RM

There are a nunber of packages that makes you able to compute skewness,
there are some: `e1071`, `moments`, `PerformanceAnalytics` etc. I will
suggest to use moments. So if you dont have it installed execute:

    install.packages("moments")
    library(moments)

Then use teh function `skewnes` on `RM_var`

    skewness(RM_var)

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres5):

H0: $\mu_{dept1} = \mu_{dept2}$ H1: $\mu_{dept1} \neq \mu_{dept2}$

Remember you always test the alternative hypothesis H1. If the pvalue
for the t test is not statistically significant then you reject H1 and
conversely you accept H0, in this case means being the same (they are
different but that's because of randomness in data, i.e. sampling
variation).

    t.test(x = perf_table$dept_1, y = perf_table$dept_2, paired = F, alternative = "two.sided")

Then we look at the p-value for this test and we see something like:
**0.4076**, so we can conclude that the Two Sample t-test testing the
difference between dept_1 and dept_2 (mean of dept_1 = 5.56, mean of
dept_2 = 4.75) suggests that the effect is positive, statistically **not
significant, and small**. So we reject the alt. hypo H1 and accept H0.

The question tells you if you can reject the Null Hypo, this is not the
case since you just accepted it!

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres6):

This is exactly the same reasoning as before except that this is a
paired t test. "Are we talking about the same individuals? are we
checking individuals pre and after a treatment?" **YES**

    t.test(x = stores$before, y = stores$after, paired = T, alternative = "two.sided")

Look at the p-value: **p-value = 0.0004646**.this is really small. SO we
can conclude that the Paired t-test testing the difference between
before and after (mean difference = -6.80) suggests that the effect is
negative, statistically significant, and large.

    t.test(X, Y, alternative = "two.sided", paired = F)

so the answer may look something like: The (Welch, remember we did not
check variance so we rely on default R behavior applying a
transformation to t.test) Sample t-test testing the difference between X
and Y (mean of x = 4.33, mean of y = 3.33) suggests that the effect is
positive, statistically not significant, and large given the pvalue

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres11):

the test statistic is calculated seeing, for example, how many times the
absolute difference between the sample mean and the population mean
(sm-mu) embodies the standard error = sqrt[(known variance)/n]. This
value allow us to standardize the distribution and allocate the value in
a Normal distribution (if the variance is known) or in a T di Student
distribution (variance unknown) - looking at this value we can now
calculate the probability that it is within the range of values
established by the level of confidence of the statistical test.

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres16):

Please note that correlation with `cor()` can be computed with only
numeric values. Looking at `iris` you see the variable `species` which
is a factor (aka grouping variable) we used that for ANOVA `aov()` when
we are interested in comparing means across more than 2 groups. As a
result you need to select all the variables but `Species` and do
`cor()`.

    iris_filtr = select(iris, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width)
    cor(iris_filtr)

there's another way to do the filtering stuff, you just deselect
`Species` such that:

    iris_filtr2 = select(iris, -Species)
    cor(iris_filtr2)


You also might want to visualize the correlation as we did before (advanced trick):

    library(corrplot)
    iris_filtr2 = select(iris, -Species)
    corrplot::corrplot(cor(iris_filtr2))

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres19):

Adjusted R2 is a corrected goodness-of-fit (model accuracy) measure for linear models. It identifies the percentage
of variance in the target field that is explained by the input or
inputs. R2 tends to optimistically estimate the fit of the linear
regression. It always increases as the number of effects are included in
the model. Adjusted R2 attempts to correct for this overestimation.
Adjusted R2 might decrease if a specific effect does not improve the
model. If you guessed the `To account for the number of parameters` this
would also get you some points, But more precisely we are talking about
the **degrees of freedom**.

$R_{adj}^2 = 1- \frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}$

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres20):


As you may know Multicollinearity is problem that you can run into when
you're fitting a regression model, or other linear model. It refers to
predictors that are correlated with other predictors in the model.
Unfortunately, the effects of multicollinearity can feel murky and
intangible, which makes it unclear whether it's important to fix.
Multicollinearity results in unstable parameter estimates which makes it
very difficult to assess the effect of independent variables on
dependent variables.

Let's see that from another pov:

Consider the simplest case where $Y$ is regressed against $X$ and $Z$
such that $Y = \alpha + \beta_1X +\beta_2Z + \epsilon$ and where $Z$ and
$Z$ are highly positively correlated. Then the effect of $X$ on $Y$ is
hard to distinguish from the effect of $Z$ on $Y$ because any increase
in $X$ tends to be associated with an increase in $Z$. Now let's also
consider th pathological case where $X = Z$ highlights this further.
$Y = \alpha + \beta_1X + \beta_2Z + \epsilon$ -\>
$Y = \alpha + (\beta_1 + \beta_2)X + 0Z + \epsilon$ then both of the two
variables would be indistinguishable.

$\frac{1}{1-R^2}$

**Answer to Question** \@ref(exr:intres22):

first attempt:

    library(carData)
    library(car)
    data("Wong")
    wong_regression = lm(piq ~ age + days + duration, data = Wong)
    summary(wong_regression)

From here you see that `age` and `days` are not significant, indeed
`duration` is. However `days` havign .13 as p values is much more
significant than age which accounts for .38 Let's also check
collinearity for this **uncorrectly specified** model. They all look
good since their values are all **\<10**.

Then we mnay want to see how the model, behaves by cancelling out `age`
and keeping `days`, so:

    wong_regression_2 = lm(piq ~ days + duration, data = Wong)

In this iteration we verify that `duration` becomes even more important
since now has \*\*\*. However `days` just got worst. We finally remove
it too. We don't check `vif()` we have already done that and we do not
expect that a subset of non collinear varibales (as before) now become
collinear. As a result:ù

    wong_regression_3 = lm(piq ~ duration, data = Wong)

In the end we only retain `duration`

We look at `Species` (we have already gone through that during lecture)
by inspecting the dataset. What we see is that `Species` has three
categories *setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*. If we would like to
compare means across these 3 different categories we can't use
`t.test()` since they are 3. Instead we use **ANOVA** with the `aov()`.
Sintax is similar to linear models. We saw this when we were trying to
tackle "long" format data vs. "wide" format data.

    test_species = aov(Sepal.Length~Species, data = iris)
    summary(test_species)

resulting in **0.0000000000000002**, very significant. We can conclude
that: The ANOVA (formula: Sepal.Length \~ Species) suggests that the
main effect of Species is statistically significant and large.
