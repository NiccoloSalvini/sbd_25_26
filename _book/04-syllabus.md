If for any reasons you have trouble accessing the G Drive, still please contact [your teaching assistant](mailto:niccolo.salvini27@gmail.com). One common issue students complain is that you may need to be authorization to accessm because I may have forgotten to switch on the open to share option. If you see me, knock me on the shoulder!

This schedule is subject to change according to the pace of the class and we may schedule a further lab if you feel you are not really ready for the intermediate exam.
