# ü´∂ About

<img src="images/cattolica-logo.png" class= "cover" width="250" height="250"/> This is the official course website for Statistics & Big data @UCSC 2025 - 2026 for laboratories. This website augments lecture topics and provides exercises for home and class assignments. Additional theory wrt slides and textbook will not be part of the exam, indeed they are for your growth and hopefully in the future as quicksilver resource to recover R proficiency from lethargy.

## Exam üìù

The exam is going to be open and closed questions on theory and practice (coding part). You will be asked to provide results and sometimes code leading to these results. You can also be asked to directly provide code to solve for that exercise. The exam is going to take place in labs classroom, this means you are **not** going to have your laptop during the exam. We generally don't provide assignment neither group works. Indeed we provide intermediate exams for those who want to try them.

we are going to have **2 intermediate sessions** exams on half of the whole content of the course. This means:
- _first intermediate_: will happen typically on **November** and will be on Part 1 content (Dr. Salvini's part)
- _second intermediate_: will happen in **January/February** on Part 2 content (Prof. Dabo-Niang's part)

you can take first intermediate and take the second on each exam date within the winter session, meaning you take part 1 in Nov and part 2 in either Jan and Feb. You can **not** reject intermediates, that means if you take first part, try the second and did not perform well, you need to take the full. Grades may undergo to a review process before being official if they are particularly low. This has happened quite often, but it does not happen every time.

## üìú Honor Code {#honorcode}
Permissive but strict. If unsure, please ask the course staff!

- <span style="color: red;"><b>NOT OKAY</b></span> Pleeease, I am using ChatGPT and its derivatives on a daily basis. I understand, it's awesome and we are not enforcing any rule against it a home. Don't do that during the exam.
- <span style="color: green;"><b>OK</b></span> to search, ask in public about the systems we‚Äôre studying. Cite all the resources you reference.
E.g. if you read it in a paper, cite it. If you ask on Quora, include the link.
- <span style="color: red;"><b>NOT OKAY</b></span> to ask someone to do assignments/projects for you, we are monitoring freelancing websites, we have a plethora of bots doing this job daily.
- <span style="color: green;"><b>OK</b></span> to discuss questions with classmates. Disclose your discussion partners.
- <span style="color: red;"><b>NOT OKAY</b></span> to blindly copy solutions from classmates.
- <span style="color: green;"><b>OK</b></span> to use existing solutions as part of your projects/assignments. Clarify your contributions.
- <span style="color: red;"><b>NOT OKAY</b></span> to pretend that someone‚Äôs solution is yours.
- <span style="color: green;"><b>OK</b></span> to publish your final project after the course is over (we encourage that and if you need it I would love to help you!)
- <span style="color: red;"><b>NOT OKAY</b></span> to post your assignment solutions online.
